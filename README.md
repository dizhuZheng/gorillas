# gorrilas
# In this game, two gorillas are standing on the top of randomly generated buildings and take turns throwing explosive bananas at each other.

# In each round, the players set the angle and velocity of the throw, and keep refining it, until they hit the other gorilla. The flying banana bomb is affected by gravity and the wind.
#
# The original game did not support a mouse. Every round, the players had to type in the angle and the velocity with a keyboard. 
# We are going to implement it with mouse support, and nicer graphics.
